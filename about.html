    <p>I have loved drawing since childhood and started pursuing digital illustration seriously in 2019. Proficient in both realistic and anime styles, I enjoy exploring new styles as part of my practice and artistic journey.
      <p>
      </p>My achievements include winning illustration competitions organized by XP-Pen Canada and Huion Espa√±ol. I was awarded the XP-Pen Artist 12 (2nd Gen) from an XP-Pen DTIYS competition and the Huion HS611 from a Mother's Day contest by Huion.
      <p>
      </p>With years of experience, I continue to grow and strive to create high-quality artwork.
